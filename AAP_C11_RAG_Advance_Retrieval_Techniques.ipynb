This configuration enhances the precision and efficiency of botanical information retrieval and generation, ideal for academic research, educational content, and professional consultation.\n",

        "**Multi-Query Retriever**: This technique allows the system to handle multiple queries simultaneously or queries with multiple components, enhancing the system's ability to retrieve comprehensive information from a large dataset.\n",
        "**Contextual Compression**: Here, relevant information is compressed into context-rich embeddings, preserving essential data while optimizing storage and retrieval processes.\n",
        "**Long-Context Reorder**: This technique reorganizes the retrieved data to maintain coherence and relevance over extended contexts, vital for understanding complex botanical interactions and processes.\n",
        "Weaviate is utilized as the vector database, storing and managing the vector embeddings generated using OpenAI's text-embedding-03 model. These embeddings encode detailed semantic relationships within botanical texts, enabling the system to retrieve highly relevant information rapidly and accurately.\n",
