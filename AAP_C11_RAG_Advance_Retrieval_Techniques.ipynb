This configuration enhances the precision and efficiency of botanical information retrieval and generation, ideal for academic research, educational content, and professional consultation.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Multi-Query Retriever**: This technique allows the system to handle multiple queries simultaneously or queries with multiple components, enhancing the system's ability to retrieve comprehensive information from a large dataset.\n",
        "**Contextual Compression**: Here, relevant information is compressed into context-rich embeddings, preserving essential data while optimizing storage and retrieval processes.\n",
        "**Long-Context Reorder**: This technique reorganizes the retrieved data to maintain coherence and relevance over extended contexts, vital for understanding complex botanical interactions and processes.\n",
        "Weaviate is utilized as the vector database, storing and managing the vector embeddings generated using OpenAI's text-embedding-03 model. These embeddings encode detailed semantic relationships within botanical texts, enabling the system to retrieve highly relevant information rapidly and accurately.\n",

It helps us under-\\nstand why plants are so vitally important to the world. Plants start the majority of\\nfood and energy chains, they provide us with oxygen, food and medicine.\\nPlants can be divided into two groups: plants 1andplants 2. Plants 1contain all pho-\\ntosynthetic organisms which use light, H 2O, and CO 2to make organic compounds\\nand O 2. Plants 1are deﬁned ecologically (based on their role in nature).\\nSome plants 1can be bacteria or even animals! One example of this a green slug,\\nElysia chlorotica (see Fig. 1.1). Green slugs collect chloroplasts from algae and use\\nthem for their entire life as food producers. Therefore, green slugs are both animals\\nand plants 1.\\nPlants 2areall organisms from Vegetabilia kingdom . Normally, plants 2are green\\norganisms with a stem and leaves. We can deﬁne them also as multi-tissued, pri-\\nmarily terrestrial and photosynthetic eukaryotes . This deﬁnition is taxonomical\\n(based on evolution).\\nIt is possible for the organism to be plant 2but not plant 1(see Fig. 1.2). Those who\\nfall into that category, are fully parasitic plants (mycoparasites like Pterospora , root\\nparasites like Hydnora , stem parasites like Cuscuta , and internal parasites like Pi-\\nlostyles) which do not practice photosynthesis but have tissues, terrestrial lifestyle\\nand originated from photosynthetic ancestors.\\n19')"

              "'Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. It begins with the light stage, where sunlight is absorbed by photosystems in the chloroplasts of plant cells. This leads to the segregation of ions, a difference in potentials, and the creation of a proton pump that generates ATP. ATP is essential for providing energy for the conversion of carbon dioxide into glucose.During the light stage, water is split into protons, electrons, and oxygen by photosystem II, which also produces ATP and forwards electrons to photosystem I. Photosystem I then uses these electrons to create NADPH, a hydrogen carrier. The light stage results in the accumulation of energy (ATP) and hydrogen (NADPH), with oxygen released as a byproduct.The enzymatic stage of photosynthesis takes place in the matrix (stroma) of the chloroplast and involves various participants such as carbon dioxide, NADPH, ATP, ribulose biphosphate (RuBP), and the enzyme Rubisco. In this stage, carbon dioxide is assimilated into short-lived C6 molecules with the help of Rubisco. These C6 molecules then break down into two C3 molecules (PGA), which participate in further complex reactions.Overall, photosynthesis is a complex process that involves the conversion of sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen through a series of light-dependent and enzymatic reactions within the chloroplasts of plant cells.'"

The logical chain of light stage reactions (hydrogen carrier not shown).\\n2.3 Enzymatic Stage\\nThe enzymatic stage has many participants. These include carbon dioxide, hydro-\\ngen carrier with hydrogen (NADPH), ATP , ribulose biphosphate (RuBP , or C 5), and\\nRubisco along with some other enzymes. Everything occurs in the matrix (stroma)\\nof the chloroplast.\\nThe main event of the enzymatic stage is CO 2assimilation with C 5into short-living\\nC6molecules. Assimilation requires Rubisco as an enzyme. Next, this temporary C 6\\nbreaks into two C 3molecules (PGA). Then, PGA will participate in the complex set of\\nreactions which spend NADPH and ATP as sources of hydrogen and energy, respec-\\ntively; and yields (through the intermediate stage of PGAL) one molecule of glucose\\n(C6H12O6) for every six assimilated molecules of CO 2. NADP+, ADP and P iwill go\\nback to the light stage. This set of chemical reactions returns RuBP which will start\\nthe new cycle of assimilation. Consequently, all reactions described in this para-\\ngraph are part of the cycle which has the name “Calvin cycle” or “C 3cycle” (because\\nthe C 3PGA molecules here are most important).\\nIn all, enzymatic stage starts with CO 2, NADPH, ATP and C 5(RuBP). It ends with\\nglucose (C 6H12O6), NADP+, ADP , P iand the same C 5. With an addition of nitrogen\\nand phosphorous, glucose will give all other organic molecules (Fig. 2.7).\\n32 Version June 7, 2021'),\n",
